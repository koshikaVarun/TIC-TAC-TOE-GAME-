# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME-

This is a Java project that implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It provides a command-line interface where players can take turns and compete against each other.

## Features

- Two players can play the game.
- The game board is displayed after each move.
- The game checks for a winning condition and declares the winner.
- If no winner is determined and the board is full, the game ends in a draw.
- The game validates player moves and provides appropriate feedback for invalid moves.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
3. The grid is represented using zero-based indices, so valid inputs for the row and column numbers are 0, 1, or 2.
4. A player wins by getting three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
5. If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used

- Java

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for future improvements:

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive game experience.
- Add an option to play against an AI opponent with different difficulty levels.
- Create a web-based version of the game using a Java web framework.
